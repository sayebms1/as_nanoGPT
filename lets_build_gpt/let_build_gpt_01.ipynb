    "so there are 8 example above. We train the transofmrer model for each of the steps above. from 1 all the way up to the block size. Transformer will be able to predict up to block size. then we have to truncate. The above is basically a time demention. then we have to look at the batch dimension. As we are sampling these chunks of text, everytime we are fedding them into a transformer we are going to have many batches of mulitple chuynks of text that are all stacked up in a single tensor. this is done for efficiency to keep the GPUs busy. because GPUs are very good with parallel processing of the data. We want to process multiple chunks all at the same time. THose chunks are odne completely inpdepndently and they dont talk to heach other."
